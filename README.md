-   Laravel utilizes [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage its dependencies.

-   I always recommend using [Laradock](https://laradock.io/), as it is faster and easier to create a Laravel environment.

# Installation

-   First make the application clone in an already configured environment. git clone https://github.com/alfjuniorbh/the-yummi-pizza-backend
-   After cloning the application, to rename the directory just execute the command: mv master the-yummi-pizza-backend
-   To access the application just type: cd the-yummi-pizza-backend
-   Some dependencies need to be installed, for this: composer install
-   Assets need to be compiled, so the commands: npm install so that all dependencies are satisfied
-   You will need to create a database and provide credentials by changing the .env file at the root of the project
-   The time has come for migrations: php artisan migrate
-   The first load of data is ready to be inserted into the system: php artisan db: seed
-   Ready, just upload the server with the command (if Docker / Laradock is not configured): php artisan serve
-   The default password: 123456
-   Enjoy

**Login**

-   Create a basic login page with the fields `email` and `password` on frontend
